# 💼 Bank Loan Analysis – Power BI Project

## 📊 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI reporting solution analyzing **38,000+ bank loan records** to uncover trends in lending performance, borrower behavior, and repayment outcomes. The dashboard suite includes dynamic visualizations that help stakeholders assess loan health, funding volumes, interest rates, and more—tailored for business users and data professionals alike.

The goal is to simulate a real-world business intelligence project, showcasing both **technical expertise** and **data storytelling** in the financial services domain.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

The bank wants to track performance and health of its loan portfolio. Business questions addressed include:

* How many loans were applied and funded month-over-month?
* What is the average interest rate and DTI ratio across borrowers?
* How do borrower characteristics (employment, location, home ownership) affect loan performance?
* What percentage of loans are considered "good" vs. "bad"?

* 🟢 **Good vs Bad Loans Breakdown**: View applications, funding, and repayments segmented by loan quality.
* 📌 **Loan Status Grid View**: Summarized insights by loan status (e.g., current, fully paid, charged off).
