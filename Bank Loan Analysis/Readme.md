## 🧩 Problem Statement – Bank Loan Analysis (BI Dashboard Project)

This project is designed to provide a comprehensive analytical view of a bank's loan portfolio through an interactive, SQL-backed Power BI dashboard. The primary objective is to help stakeholders monitor **loan performance**, assess **borrower profiles**, and evaluate **risk** across various dimensions.

By transforming raw loan data into business-ready visualizations, this solution enables clear, actionable insights for decision-makers in the banking and finance domain.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

The bank is looking for a user-friendly, real-time reporting tool that answers the following key questions:

* How many loan applications are we receiving month over month?
* How much funding is being disbursed and recovered?
* What is the financial health of our borrowers?
* How do different borrower attributes (state, employment, purpose) affect loan outcomes?
* What portion of our portfolio is high-performing vs. high-risk?

## 📊 Summary Dashboard – KPI Monitoring

The **Summary Dashboard** delivers high-level performance metrics (KPIs) crucial for understanding overall lending activity. These KPIs include:

1. **Total Loan Applications**

   * Displays total applications received within a time range
   * Includes **Month-to-Date (MTD)** and **Month-over-Month (MoM)** tracking

2. **Total Funded Amount**

   * Captures the total amount of loans disbursed
   * Includes MTD and MoM comparisons to detect funding trends

3. **Total Amount Received**

   * Reflects repayments received from borrowers
   * MTD and MoM views help assess recovery and cash flow

4. **Average Interest Rate**

   * Calculates average lending interest across all loans
   * MTD and MoM changes offer insights into cost of lending

5. **Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio**

   * Gauges borrower financial health and affordability
   * Includes trend comparisons to monitor risk patterns

## ✅ Good vs. Bad Loan Analysis

To evaluate loan performance quality, loans are categorized into two groups:

### Good Loans:

* Total Applications
* Funded Amount
* Amount Received
* % Share of Total Applications

### Bad Loans:

* Total Applications
* Funded Amount
* Amount Received
* % Share of Total Applications

This breakdown helps assess **portfolio risk**, improve credit strategies, and monitor default exposure.

## 📌 Loan Status Grid View

A tabular view that consolidates key metrics grouped by **Loan Status** (e.g., Current, Fully Paid, Charged Off). It enables quick comparisons and health checks of the entire loan portfolio using:

* Total Applications
* Total Funded Amount
* Amount Received
* MTD Funded Amount
* MTD Amount Received
* Average Interest Rate
* Average DTI Ratio


  
## 📋 Overview Dashboard – Executive Summary

The **Overview Dashboard** consolidates key figures and visualizations into one clean interface, allowing users to:

* Monitor real-time performance at a glance
* Switch between different filters and KPIs
* Navigate easily to deeper insights across borrower segments

This dashboard acts as the **control center** for strategic decision-making.

## 🔍 Details Dashboard – Deep Dive Visual Analysis

The **Details Dashboard** gives a closer look at borrower behavior, demographic patterns, and lending segmentation using visual tools:

1. **Monthly Trends (Line Chart)** – Track seasonal and long-term trends in applications and funding.
2. **Regional Analysis (Filled Map)** – Visualize lending activity by state to identify geographic trends and risk areas.
3. **Loan Term Distribution (Donut Chart)** – Analyze loans by term (e.g., 36 months vs. 60 months).
4. **Employment Length (Bar Chart)** – Discover how borrower job history affects loan approval or repayment.
5. **Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart)** – Categorize loans by purpose (e.g., home improvement, debt consolidation).
6. **Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map)** – Understand how home ownership status influences loan metrics.

All visuals include metrics like **Applications, Funded Amount, and Amount Received** for contextual insights.
