üìä CHURN ANALYSIS DASHBOARD PROJECT

This project showcases a complete end-to-end solution for analyzing and predicting customer churn using real-world data. 
The dashboard was built using SQL Server, Power BI, and Python (Random Forest) for machine learning.

üîß Key Features:

1) ETL Pipeline: Built robust data pipelines in SQL Server for importing, cleaning, and transforming customer data (demographics, services, payments, churn).

2) Power BI Visualizations: Created dynamic dashboards to track churn rate, customer segmentation, revenue insights, and service usage.

3) Data Modeling: Designed an efficient data model and implemented DAX measures for KPIs such as total customers, churn rate, and new joiners.

4) Machine Learning Integration: Developed a Random Forest model in Python to predict churn; evaluated with classification report and confusion matrix.

5) Predictive Dashboard: Integrated ML predictions into Power BI to visualize high-risk customers and support business decisions.

6) UI Enhancements: Applied custom themes, layout design, and visual storytelling for better user experience and insight delivery.

üñºÔ∏è Dashboard Snapshots:

Here‚Äôs a look at the three dashboards I built in Power BI. Each one is designed to provide valuable insights for different parts of the business, from high-level overviews to churn predictions and data-driven summaries.

üìç 1. Overview Dashboard:


The Overview Dashboard provides a clear, high-level view of customer behavior and business performance. It highlights key metrics such as churn rate, customer segments, service adoption, and usage patterns‚Äîhelping stakeholders quickly grasp the overall state of the business.

üìç 2. Prediction Dashboard (Powered by Machine Learning):


The Prediction Dashboard takes things a step further by using machine learning to identify customers who are most likely to churn. Powered by a Random Forest regression model, it displays each customer's churn risk alongside key details like their profile and service usage‚Äîenabling the business to take proactive steps before it's too late.

üìç 3. Summary Dashboard (Smart Narrative):


The Summary Dashboard focuses on making insights easy to understand. By using Power BI‚Äôs Smart Narrative feature, it automatically generates clear, written explanations of key metrics like total customers, churn figures, and revenue trends. This helps decision-makers quickly grasp what's happening in the business without diving deep into the data.
